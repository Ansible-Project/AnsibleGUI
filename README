This is an editor for basically your Ansible work directory.

=======================================================================
Make sure the Tomcat running this *IS NOT* accessible from outside!!!
There is no authentication needed and this application accesses any
files it can. You have been warned. If you know your way around Tomcat,
you might want to leverage Tomcat user authentication, even if you are
on your own development network.
=======================================================================

(Hint: You can save shortcuts like
http://localhost:8080/Ansible/index.jsp?anspath=/usr/local/ansible/project1
in your webbrowser for quick access).

It will scan all the YAML and ASCII text files, descending down the
sub-directories as needed. Note that the Tomcat user *must* have read/write
access to all the files and directories for this to work!
It should locate and load all playbooks, task, templates and so on and present
them on the main page.
You can click on any linked item to open it in a simple plain-text editor.
Edited files will be saved over the existing ones without any backup; the use
of a (local) source code repository is strongly recommended alongside this
editor.

A note on editing YAML files. This editor uses YAMLBeans so you can use any
YAML features that fall in the sub-set of what is supported by both YAMLBeans
and Ansible itself.
When editing a .yml file, it is read using YAMLBeans and converted to text for
your editing. When you save the edited text, the reverse happens: your text is
interpreted as being YAML and the resulting object is saved to the file.

This project is in BETA (which means it is fully functional for *my* set of
Ansible files) and might still produce some screens filled with
Java exceptions; depending on the complexity (or age) of your Ansible projects.

Which is *why* it is releases as Open Source; please feel free to fix bugs,
create some documentation, add some styling to the horrid white pages and so
on. All help is welcome!

IDE: NetBeans. 
Depends on: YAMLBeans.jar, Tomcat 6.0+, Java 7+
Included: A possible project in its own right, a set of Java classes around the
DOM interface called JavaHTML. For now I just put those classes in this project.
Tested on: Tomcat6 & 7, OpenJDK 7, my current set of Ansible files.

Hoping to have helped someone out there,
